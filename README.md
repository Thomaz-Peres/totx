This is for learning more Rust and compiler (of course). I read the docs some time ago but didn't continue practicing, so I forgot a lot. It's a good time to read the book and learn more about Rust too.


Starting the Crafting Compilers, after I started watching the youtube video [here](https://github.com/Thomaz-Peres/Study-Notes/issues/4), I stopped to study other things and never went back. Now I'm returning, but with the book I saved many years ago watching Eduardo on twitch


This is old code, on that [repo](https://github.com/Thomaz-Peres/Study-Notes/tree/master/Computer_Science/Compiler_Interpreters/rust), when I was watching the Youtube video, and I'm going to start from here.
